## Summary
**BMX** by **Morphex** innovates upon the generic GMX model by removing escrowed tokens and single-staking entirely. Through our innovative design model, BMX allows access of the underlying liquidity that forms **BLT**, our GLP equivalent. This is done through our native yearn-architectured, auto-compounding vault token, wBLT. Additionally, we have paired **wBLT** with our native-protocol token, **BMX**, to form our native liquidity pair (**wBLT-BMX**) without the need for a wETH or second native liquidity pair.

**BMX** by **Morphex** improves capital efficiency for the protocol by eliminating competition between trading liquidity (**BLT**) and native-protocol liquidity (pool2), supports increased protocol revenue through minting and redemption fees of wBLT for option-exercises and arbitrage opportunities. BMX improves capital efficiency for liquidity providers who co-support trading liquidity and native protocol liquidity (**wBLT-BMX**) as **90%** of protocol revenue and other native and external incentives are earned. 

The most significant innovation is the introduction of **wBLT** as a product with multiple use cases all built on top of auto-compounding **BLT** rewards: **wBLT-BMX** native protocol liquidity, ability to be paired with other assets (wBLT-(other asset)) which benefits protocols through **wBLT**’s auto-compounding rewards in addition to the underlying **BLT** assets being an index of blue-chip assets, can be collateralized to allow users to continue to earn auto-compounding rewards while borrowing against their **wBLT** position (never allowed to borrow wBLT itself), is used as an option-payment token to exercise oBMX and can be used in the future as a payment option for other use-cases such as another protocols option-tokens payment, for protocol salary streams, or other products/services.

**Morphex** is a collective of contributors who are anonymous to one another and live all across the world, contributing to the success of **Morphex** alongside a *powerful community*. **Morphex** believes in decentralization, self-custody, and on-chain actions, and never has access to or holds user funds. At the time of writing, **Morphex** is the *largest perpetual trading platform* on **Fantom** by TVL and margin trading volume, with nearly **$500mm total volume** since inception. **Morphex** launched only a few months ago on **BNB Chain** and has done nearly **$65mm total volume**. We look forward to showcasing **BMX** by **Morphex** on **BASE** alongside continued support for **Morphex** on **Fantom** and **BNB Chain**, as plans for each are to work towards transitioning from their current models towards **BMX** by **Morphex**’s model.

We look forward to the future and from all of us at **Morphex**, thank you for taking the time to learn more about **BMX** by **Morphex** and **wBLT** as a product. If you have any questions, comments or concerns, please feel free to reach out in **Discord** or on **X** (formerly Twitter).
